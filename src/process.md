## Process

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
  <div class="">
  {% simplFigure 'tool_idea.svg', 'icon sketch tool', '', 'w-48' %}

  ### I. Planning
  In the beginning of a project we define goals and mission success. We create a list of deliverables and a set milestones. It is the stage, where i get to know you, the client, and your communiction needs.

  <div class="">
  {% simplFigure 'tool_crack.svg', 'icon magic tool', '', 'w-48' %}

  ### II. Creation
 After a reasonable time a presentation is prepared with a draft for all planned branding and communication items. Now it is time for the feedback. I iterate over the presentation. Two rounds are usually sufficiant and included in the quote.

  <div class="">
  {% simplFigure 'tool_sunny.svg', 'icon exact tool', '', 'w-48' %}

  ### III. Production
  Now all deliverables are being produced.
  Little communication is necessary at this stage, once the presentation is cleared for production.
  Below is a list of a couple of tools and technologies, that i use in production.

## Tools & Technologies

### Web
Usually i recommend wordpress as plattform, because it offers easy ways to manage the content for the client. Also, since it is such a popular plattform, there are plugins for everthing, so the functionality of the website can be expanded with only small costs in time and money.

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html)  - for UI Design, for Wireframing, Design and Prototyping
- [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) - for CMS and Theme development
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styling
- [11ty Static site Generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) - This site was build in 11ty

### Illustration and Sketching
Pen and paper is always the starting point. It has a intuitive connection to the mind, that digital tools just dont provide for me. Later in creation, and at the very least, in production, digital tools are welcome and necessary.

- [Pro Create](https://procreate.art/) for Ipad - a very intuitive tool for sketching and thinking with a pen, second best only to actual pen and paper.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html/) 

### Animation
- [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/aftereffects.html) - the industry standard
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - a free and open source tool for 3d creation and animation. I am just starting out with this, at the moment it is more a toy than a tool for me
