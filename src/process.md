  ### I. Planning
  In the beginning i get to know you and your product/brand/idea.
  - What do you want to communicate?
  - to whom?
  - and how shall it feel like?
  
  In this stage, we define goals and mission success. We create a list of deliverables and a set milestones.

### II. Creation
The creative work includes many trial & errors. The drafts, that pass the test are then delivered in a first presentation.

Now it is time for feedback:
- Can you make it more/less serious ?
- We love the colors!
- Can you make the logo bigger? ;)

I knead in the changes. Two rounds are usually sufficiant.

  ### III. Production
  Once the presentation is cleared for production, all deliverables are being produced.
  
  Below is a list of a couple of tools and technologies, that i like to use.

## Tools & Technologies

### Web
Usually i recommend wordpress as plattform, because it offers easy ways to manage the content for the client. Also, since it is such a popular plattform, there are plugins for everthing, so the functionality of the website can be expanded with only small costs in time and money.

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html)  - for UI Design, for Wireframing, Design and Prototyping
- [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) - for CMS and Theme development
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styling
- [11ty Static site Generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) - When the Website does not need a full content managment system.

### Illustration and Sketching
Pen and paper is always the starting point. It has a intuitive connection to the mind, that digital tools just dont provide for me. Later in creation, and at the very least, in production, digital tools are welcome and necessary.

- [Pro Create](https://procreate.art/) for Ipad - a very intuitive tool for sketching and thinking with a pen, second best only to actual pen and paper.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html/) 

### Animation
- [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/aftereffects.html) - the industry standard
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - a free and open source tool for 3d creation and animation. I am just starting out with this, at the moment it is more a toy than a tool for me
