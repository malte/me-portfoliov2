## Process

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
  <div id="idea">
    <div class="mx-auto mb-12 w-48 h-48 text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-500">
      {% inlineSvg 'tool_idea.svg' %}
    </div>
  
### I. Planning
In the beginning i get to know you and your product/brand/idea.
- What do you want to communicate?
- to whom?
- and how should it feel like?
  
In this stage, we define goals and mission success. We create a list of deliverables and a set milestones. 

  </div>
  <div id="crack">
    <div class="mx-auto mb-12 w-48 h-48 text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-500">
      {% inlineSvg 'tool_crack.svg' %}
    </div>


### II. Creation
The creative work includes many trial & errors. The drafts, that pass the test are then delivered in a first presentation.

Now it is time for feedback:
- Can you make it more/less serious ?
- We love the colors!
- Can you make the logo bigger? ;)

I knead in the changes. Two rounds are usually sufficiant.

  <div id="sunny">
    <div class="mx-auto mb-12 w-48 h-48 text-purple-600 dark:text-purple-500">
      {% inlineSvg 'tool_sunny.svg' %}
    </div>

### III. Production
Once the presentation is cleared for production, all deliverables are being produced.
   
Below is a list of a couple of tools and technologies, that i like to use.

## Tools & Technologies

### Web
Usually i recommend wordpress as plattform, because it offers easy ways to manage the content for the client. Also, since it is such a popular plattform, there are plugins for everthing, so the functionality of the website can be expanded with only small costs in time and money.

- [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/xd.html)  - for UI Design, for Wireframing, Design and Prototyping
- [Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.org) with [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) - for CMS and Theme development
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for styling
- [11ty Static site Generator](https://www.11ty.dev/) - When the Website does not need a full content managment system.

### Illustration and Sketching
Pen and paper is always the starting point. It has a intuitive connection to the mind, that digital tools just dont provide for me. Later in creation, and at the very least, in production, digital tools are welcome and necessary.

- [Pro Create](https://procreate.art/) for Ipad - a very intuitive tool for sketching and thinking with a pen, second best only to actual pen and paper.
- [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html/) 

### Animation
- [After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/de/products/aftereffects.html) - the industry standard
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) - a free and open source tool for 3d creation and animation. I am just starting out with this, at the moment it is more a toy than a tool for me
