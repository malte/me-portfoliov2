## Branding Goals
The brand was to incorporate an african flair without being clichee, since this is a 'white' company from europe, that not really has a say in what is african. So we just decided on a very bright and colorful design, utilizing strong colors, that you my find printed on a lot of fabrics in kenya. The motive of the logo is the silhoutte of a bird, that you may find in both continents, since it is a wanderer, the common swift, also symbolising the exchange.
