<div class="md col-[1_/_span_6] sm:col-[4_/_span_3] about">

I am a mutlidiscplinary designer and illustrator with a diploma in communication design from Kunsthochschule Wei√üensee in Berlin.

My clients range spans different industries including film, music, culture, medical and technical companies and producers.

Besides logo design and corporate design my services include webdesign and development (mostly custom wordpress), illustration and storyboarding for commercials and feature films.

Sometimes i freelance for design agencies like [anschlaege.de](https://www.anschlaege.de) in Berlin or [HOAX](https://hoax-amsterdam.com) in Amsterdam.

With a new assignment, my focus lies on understanding the clients needs and the atmosphere they want to establish with their communication.
Then i set to solve the problem to a clear solution. Where possible i sprinkle with humor or poetry.
